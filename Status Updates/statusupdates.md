# Assignment 3 Status Update Log 

Lachie — 07/14/2021
Hi oliver, just doing a status update for my assignment (let me know if i should send it too you somehwere else). I've settled on writing a typing game application. its features will include difficulty selection, text highlighting that indicates the current word being typed and if previous words were correct or incorrect and score calculation with words per minute and accuracy and scoreboard. ive made pretty good progress so far and go the text highlighting toward - which i expected to be the most challenging part of the program.

Hi oliver here is my second status update for my assignment. the assignment is due today and i have just completed all of my features. I just got rid one of the final bugs of my program - as the input was being collected and processed for each character received, the default behavior of echoing input was removed which meant that the user couldnt see the words they were typing  and also special characters like backspace would be added to the words instead of taking characters away. ive now added printing of the input (on the same line) and conditions to ignore special characters or in the case of backspace remove a letter from the word. Pretty happy with how everything has turned out. All other documentation and requirements are completed except testing, which i plan to complete today before submitting.
