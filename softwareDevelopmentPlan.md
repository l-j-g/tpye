# Assignment 3: Python Terminal Application

## Software Development Plan

### Author: Lachlan Greve - S

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

*Tpye* is a terminal based typing game written in the Python programing language. The ability to type quickly and accurately is a core skill of being able to use a computer effectively. This program provides a tool for users to practice monitor and improve their typing skills in a fun and engaging way. The application has been designed to accommodate users of all skills and backgrounds through a variable difficulty setting.  

Before starting the application please ensure that all of the system environment requirements have been met. Navigate to your *type* installation folder and execute the following command in your command line prompt: 
`-pip3 install -r path/to/your/requirements.txt`

To start the application enter: `tpye` at your command line prompt.

- Explain how the member audience will use it.

## Features

### User identification

### Variable Difficulty 
The user will have the option of selecting difficulty (beginner, intermediate, expert) at the start of the application. The difficulty variable will change the passage of text that the user is required to type with the following variations: 

- beginner: the passage of text will have no capitalization, no grammar and use simple words.
- intermediate: the passage of text will have some capitalization, grammar and use words of mixed complexity.
- expert: the passage of text will have a high level of capitalization, grammar and use complex words.

### Score Calculation

Once the user has typed the required passage of text the application will calculate the users accuracy, and typing speed (in words per minute).


### Scoreboard

The top 10 high scores for each difficulty setting will be retained. 



- At least 3 features, describe each.
- Include use of variables, loops and conditional statements, error handling.

## User Interaction and Experiance

- How the user will find out about how to interact with each feature
- How the user will interact with each feature
- How errors will be handled and displayed to the user. 

## Control flow diagram

- Provide Image of control flow diagram
- Show workflow / logic and integration of features in your application for each feature.
- Use recognised format such as UML.

## Implementation Plan

- Outline how each feature will be implemented with a checklist of tasks for each feature
- Prioritise implementation of differnet features or items within a feature.
- Provide a deadline duration or other time indicator for each item.
